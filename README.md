# Extensions - Readwn Familia
In case of Shosetsu error add extension from this repo then remove old extension and then this extension. Wait and reinstall old extension.

Do not let both extensions installed (even though they work that way).

P.S. I don't know shit about coding. I'm just addicted to reading.

#### Add the repo to Shosetsu using this Url:
